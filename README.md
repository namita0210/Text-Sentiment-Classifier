# Text-Classification
This repository contains a binary text classification project trained with pretrained models on twitter sentiments dataset and then deployed using Flask and Streamlit.

## Deep Learning & NLP Project: Text Classification with Pretrained Models
Project Overview
This project involves building a text classification model using deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We will utilize pretrained transformer models like BERT or DistilBERT and fine-tune them for a specific NLP task, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or news categorization.

##Project Steps
1. Choose a Dataset
Select a text dataset for your classification task. Some options include:

Sentiment Analysis: IMDb movie reviews or Twitter sentiment analysis (positive/negative sentiment).
Spam Detection: SMS Spam Collection dataset.
News Categorization: 20 Newsgroups dataset (categorize articles into different news topics).
Topic Classification: AG News dataset for classifying news articles by topic.
2. Preprocess the Data
Text Cleaning: Tokenize the text, remove stop words, punctuation, and lowercase the text.
Text Vectorization: Use pretrained embeddings such as BERT or DistilBERT to convert text into vector representations.
Padding & Tokenization: Ensure the text sequences are of consistent length to feed into neural networks.
3. Fine-tune Pretrained Transformer Models
Use Hugging Face's Transformers library to load pretrained models like BERT, DistilBERT, or RoBERTa.
Fine-tune the model on your classification task by adapting the last layers of the model.
Use PyTorch or TensorFlow to work with these models, training them on your dataset.
4. Model Evaluation
Split your dataset into training and validation sets.
Evaluate your model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques like dropout and learning rate scheduling.
5. Model Deployment
Once the model is trained, deploy it using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit to create a simple web interface.
Allow users to input text and get predictions on categories or sentiment.
Alternatively, build a REST API to interact with the model.
6. Optional Features
Visualization: Visualize model performance using matplotlib or seaborn.
Transfer Learning: Explore transfer learning by fine-tuning models on different tasks.
